This directory contains a project for the Gowin IDE and is intended for
use on a Tang Nano 9K FPGA development board.

The FPGA image includes an i2c target copyright Steve Fielding and
OPENCORES.ORG.  Reads/writes via i2c from a Raspberry Pi cause
reads/writes to an SRAM created from Block SRAMs on the Gowin FPA on
the Tang Nano board.

Directory c_for_rpi contains C source code for the Raspberry Pi.

There is a YouTube video on this.
