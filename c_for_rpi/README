This directory contains a test program that works with an FPGA
bitfile that connects i2c to 16384 bytes of block sram.

I2C registers must be:

0: Address high order 8 bits (lower 6 used)
1: Address low order 8 bits
2: Data byte to write (write to register 2 triggers write to memory).
3: Data byte at address in registers 0,1. (for reading)

Install these packages, i2c-tools is to get i2cdetect, etc:

   sudo apt install i2c-tools libi2c-dev

Then "make".

The program takes arguments:

  -r addr       : read from addr
  -2 addr value : write value to addr
  -t            : Test all 16384 bytes of memory by writing and reading each.
  -s            : Like -t but test fewer addresses so it's faster.

example:

  rpi-131 ./i2c_bsram -w 0x100 0x12 -w 0x210 0x34 -r 0x100 -r 0x210
  mem[0x100] = 12
  mem[0x210] = 34
  rpi-132
